**explaination**
A** Financial Market News Sentiment Analysis** project involves analyzing news articles, financial reports, or social media posts to gauge the sentiment of the market. By applying sentiment analysis, we can measure how positive, neutral, or negative news might affect stock prices, currency exchange rates, or other financial instruments. This type of project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and financial data analysis.

**objective**
The main goal is to build a system that can automatically analyze financial news and classify the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of each article or tweet. Based on this sentiment, you can predict the potential impact on financial markets
